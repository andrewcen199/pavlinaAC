                  Twenty-five years ago at Winfield College, psycho-priest
                  Zachary Malius murdered seven frat boys.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-3 mb-lg-4">
                  Malius is waiting, secretly locked in Winfield Insane Asylum.
                  Now, he's just a myth; the local boogie man, the sick joke
                  used to scare children. Malius is not afraid to die; living
                  has cured him of that. Sonny Collins, a star freshman student
                  at Winfield College has nerves of steel and a taste for the
                  heroics. He faces the ultimate Phi Delta Kappa hazing:
                  photograph the mythical, monstrous Malius.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-3 mb-lg-4">
                  Harry Collins, Sonny's brother, is already a Phi Delta Kappa.
                  In a jealous rage and caught in a love triangle with Sonny's
                  girl, Harry would like to even the score. He wants to scare
                  his brother.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-3 mb-lg-4">
                  But when Sonny finds Malius something goes wrong, Malius
                  escapes. The horrors of his rampage, the mutilation of the Phi
                  Delta Kappa brothers is recreated. But Malius is more than a
                  psychotic killer, he is the devil's henchman brought back from
                  the dead by Sonny and his father, Henry Collins (played by
                  Darren Mc Gavin).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Henry Collins tells his sons the truth; he sold his soul. He
                  must prepare to help them outlive him.
