                  THEN: Lumiukko, the magic snowman was the voice of Roger Moore
                  and adored by children worldwide. But he did not smile, wink
                  or frown. He was too lazy for that!
                </p>
                <p className="mb-3 ">
                  In the 2022 reduxed version of this perennial children's film,
                  Lumiukko will get visibly angry, sad, concerned, and often,
                  annoyed.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-3 ">
                  With his myriad of emotions, he will engage the children more
                  than ever before and ultimately teaches them to believe in
                  themselves and the choices they have to make.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through the wonderful possibilities offered by CGI and by
                  adding a fresh new score and a sound mix, the re-edited
                  version of this evergreen staple will give the new generation
                  of children a fresh look at a film their parents grew up with.
