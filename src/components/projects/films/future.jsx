                      Borders in Heaven is a fish-out-of-water romantic comedy
                      that takes place in a small village in Macedonia called
                      Heaven. The main protagonist, Donna Lee, is a native New
                      Yorker who is sent there to investigate an insurance
                      scheme perpetrated by the locals.

                    <p className="mb-3 mb-lg-4">
                      The tranquil Macedonian countryside is a dramatic change
                      from Donna Lee's fast-paced life in New York. The medieval
                      village is a perfect setting for a clash of two very
                      different ways of life, and an ideal stage for surprises,
                      obstacles and emotional outbursts. Emotional borders and
                      even physical ones are shattered with the help of a
                      village patriarch, a loose-lipped mailman and a deaf and
                      hard of hearing goat herder. A US-educated village doctor
                      is the link between the two worlds and a catalyst for the
                      ripples in Donna Lee's heartbeat. Magical realism through
                      a few other local characters adds a Don Quixotesque
                      atmosphere to the film. The more realistic aspects of the
                      story are reminiscent of notable classics like Cinema
                      Paradiso, Local Hero and Il Postino.

                      Festival and a big ski jumping contest held at the start

                      Festival, preoccupied by the tricks of the recently

                      the Cultural Revolution on Lee Chen, who in 1951
                      unknowingly participated in mass murder. Chairman Mao's
                      decrees to kill off the birds in order to increase crop
                      yield is at first amusing to a little seven-year old girl
                      who uses pots and pans to scare off the birds to the point
                      that they wall dead to the ground, from the aimless
                      exhausting flutter in the air. In 1951 there were no
                      sparrows left in China, only mosquitoes that brought
                      malaria and death to millions of people. The film is both
                      a period and contemporary tale that shows the degrading
                      nature of fascism on the human spirit.

                      newly formed cooperatives that can be indoctrinated to
                      become the new class. In 1949 a law is passed that calls
                      for the annihilation of the goats under the pretext that
                      the animals are destroying the forests. Those who don’t
